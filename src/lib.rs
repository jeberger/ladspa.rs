#![feature(libc, vecmap, cstr_memory)]

/*!
 * The ```ladspa``` crate provides an interface for writing [LADSPA](http://www.ladspa.org/)
 * plugins safely in Rust.
 *
 * ##Creating the project
 *
 * Run ```cargo new my_ladspa_plugin``` to generate a Cargo project for your plugin, then add
 * the following to the generated Cargo.toml:
 *
 * ```
 * [dependencies]
 * ladspa = "*"
 *
 * [lib]
 * name = "my_ladspa_plugin"
 * crate-type = ["dylib"]
 * ```
 * This will pull in the correct dependency and ensure that the library generated when you build
 * your plugin is compatible with LADSPA hosts.
 *
 * ## Writing the code
 * You'll want to implement
 * ```get_ladspa_descriptor``` in your src/lib.rs. This function is expected to return 1 or more
 * ```PluginDescriptor```s describing the plugins exposed by your library. See the documentation
 * for ```get_ladspa_descriptor``` and the examples
 * [on Github](https://github.com/nwoeanhinnogaehr/ladspa.rs/tree/master/examples) for more
 * information.
 *
 * ## Testing it out
 * There is a list of host software supporting LADSPA on the
 * [LADSPA home page](http://www.ladspa.org/). In order for a host to find your plugin, you will
 * either need to copy the *.so file from target/ after building to /usr/lib/ladspa/ (on most
 * systems, it may be different on your system) or set the enviornment variable ```LADSPA_PATH```
 * to equal the directory where you store your plugins.
